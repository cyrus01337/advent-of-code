The fancy system thing I made will have an actual explanation soon, for now you can just run the days using `[pkgm] start --day n` and define a part using the `--part` CLI arg. I'll document it properly later, mostly did it to get familiar with yargs and have fun. The usage should be in the docstring atop `src/index.js`.
